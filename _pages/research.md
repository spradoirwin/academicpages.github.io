Ecology and evolution of mainland and island <i>Anolis</i> lizards
======
I am currently interested in understanding why and how evolutionary and ecological process differ between island and mainland environments. I'm addressing these questions usinga group Central American <i>Anolis</i> lizards as a case study.

Host-microbiome interaction in <i>Ensatina</i> salamanders
======
I  completed my Masterâ€™s degree at San Francisco State University (Vredenburg/Zink labs), where I explored variation in skin-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) on several subspecies of Ensatina eschscholtzii salamanders. The field of amphibian microbiome research is relatively new, so for my project I set out to answer several basic questions about the host-microbiome relationship. First, are skin microbial communities are primarily obtained from the environment or other members of the population (or community)? Second, does the skin microbial community change over ontogeny? Third, how does the skin microbiome change across a hybrid zone? My first paper from this project was recently published in the journal Microbial Ecology, check it out here! Stay tuned for more publications in the future.
