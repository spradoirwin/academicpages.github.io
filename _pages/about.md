I am a graduate student in the Losos Lab at Harvard University, where I am studying patterns of evolution in island and mainland *Anolis* lizards. My interests range from ecology to physiology to conservation and beyond, but all within the context of my true love, herpetology. I grew up in Colorado and attended Barnard College in New York City, where I completed a senior thesis on honey bee gut immune mechanisms. For my Master's degree at San Francisco State University I explored the host-microbiome relationship in Ensatina salamanders. I have also worked on several projects involving *Anolis* lizards, addressing questions of thermal biology, evolution, and behavior.

I made this website with the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
